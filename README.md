# rakosh

rakosh is a place to store nuggets of information. Like a knowledge base, yet built with small "nuggets" rather than pages.

raskosh is offline-first -- for now -- this is a prototype. Data are stored in an [ArangoDB](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb) database. In future there may be a server and a frontend. For now, there is a tool for depositing data into ArangoDB, and one for extracting it as a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) site.

One aim of this prototype is to develop an ontology for these "nuggets" of information and the relationships between them.

This site has an example "mine" that will eventually include all possible mine structures:
