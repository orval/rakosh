### Green Eggs and Ham

In a land far away, with a sky bright and blue,
Lived creatures with stripes and spots and hues.
Their language was strange, it rhymed and it flowed,
Like a song that the trees in the wind gently sowed.

One day, a young creature named Yertle,
Said, "I want to be king, I want to be fertile!"
So he gathered his friends, and they built a great stack,
Of turtles and shells, with Yertle on top, to attack.

But the weight was too much, the turtles cried out,
"We can't take it anymore, we're starting to pout!"
So Yertle fell down, and his friends were set free,
Learning that kindness and sharing was the key.
