## README

rakosh is a place to store nuggets of information. Like a knowledge base, yet built with small "nuggets" rather than pages.

raskosh is offline-first -- for now -- this is a prototype. Data are stored in an [ArangoDB](https://github.com/arangodb/arangodb) database. In future there may be a server and a frontend. For now, there is a tool for depositing data into ArangoDB, and one for extracting it as a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) site.

One aim of this prototype is to develop an [ontology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ontology_%28computer_science%29) for these "nuggets" of information and the relationships between them.
