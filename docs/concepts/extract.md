### Extract

Since rakosh is offline-first, one needs to extract content from a mine to be able to consume it. The rakosh CLI currently supports one extraction target: a [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) site. Once extracted and built, the site can be served as static content from a webserver.

The next extraction to come will be the creation of a set of Atlassian Confluence Cloud pages.
