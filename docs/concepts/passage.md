### Passage

A passage vertex represents a route from one part of the mine to another. Nuggets exist within a passage, in fact they can exist in more than one passage.

A passage can hold content like a nugget. Originally it was just a labelled link between nuggets but that lead to unnecessarily complexity in the graph.
