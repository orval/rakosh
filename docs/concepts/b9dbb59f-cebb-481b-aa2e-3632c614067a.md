### Mine

Since a gold nugget might be found in a gold mine, the terminology used in the design of rakosh is related to mines.

In the ArangoDB graph database system used to store rakosh mines, one [Database](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/3.10/data-modeling-databases.html) maps to one rakosh mine.

To model a rakosh mine there are four [Collections](https://www.arangodb.com/docs/3.10/data-modeling-collections.html):

* [Nugget](/nugget/1f36fe64-eef9-4226-b837-0f9c35814405)
* Seam
* Passage
* Edges

[This](https://orval.github.io/rakosh-example/) rakosh-generated site has an example mine that will eventually include all possible mine structures.
